# viney dua first attempt to make a project
# YouTube Backend Clone ‚Äì Production-Ready Backend API

This is a scalable, secure, and production-grade backend API inspired by YouTube functionality. The project is built using Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and related tools to handle user authentication, media uploads, and core backend logic.

## üöÄ Features Implemented So Far- 05-052025

### ‚úÖ Core Technologies Installed

| Package | Purpose | Why It's Used |
|--------|---------|----------------|
| `express` | Framework | Core server to handle routing and middleware |
| `mongoose` | ODM | Connect and interact with MongoDB efficiently |
| `dotenv` | Environment Config | Manage environment variables securely |
| `cors` | CORS Handling | Enable/disable cross-origin requests |
| `nodemon` | Dev Utility | Auto-restart server on file changes during development |
| `prettier` | Formatter | Enforce code consistency and clean style |
| `multer` | Middleware | Handle file uploads (images, videos) |
| `bcrypt` | Security | Hash user passwords securely |
| `jsonwebtoken` | Auth | Create and verify JWTs for session handling |
| `mongoose-aggregate-paginate-v2` | Pagination | Efficiently paginate MongoDB aggregate queries |
| `cloudinary` | Media Management | Upload and manage images/videos in the cloud |
| `@types/cookie-parser` | Type Support | For using cookie-parser with TypeScript (even if not TS yet) |

### ‚úÖ External Tools Used

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| [MongoDB Atlas](https://cloud.mongodb.com) | Cloud-based MongoDB database |
| [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com) | Media storage, transformations |
| [JWT.io](https://jwt.io) | Debugging and visualizing JWTs |
| [SHA256 Generator](https://tools.keycdn.com/sha256-online-generator) | Used to hash secrets (if required) |
| [Gitignore Generator](https://mrkandreev.name/snippets/gitignore-generator/#Node) | Generate optimized `.gitignore` file |

## üß† Logic Implemented So Far

### ‚úÖ Database Models

- All MongoDB schemas are defined in the `models/` folder using Mongoose.
- Constants like database names are stored centrally in the `constants/` folder.

### ‚úÖ Utilities

Located in `utils/`:

| Utility | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `apiError.js` | Standardized error object for throwing HTTP errors |
| `apiResponse.js` | Wrapper for consistent API response format |
| `asyncHandler.js` | Catches async route errors automatically |
| `cloudinary.js` | Handles image/video uploads and configurations |

### ‚úÖ DB Connection

- Configured in `db/index.js` to:
  - Read `.env` variables
  - Establish a Mongoose connection
  - Export a connection instance for use across the app

### ‚úÖ Middleware

- `middlewares/multis.js`:
  - Uses `multer` to process media uploads
  - Can handle single/multiple uploads
  - Protects endpoints that require file processing

### ‚úÖ App Entry & Express Setup

- `app.js`: 
  - Initializes Express app
  - Applies middleware like `cors`, JSON parsing, etc.
- `server.js`: 
  - Loads environment variables
  - Starts the Express server

## üåê Environment Variables Example (`.env`)


---

## üõ°Ô∏è Why This Setup is Production Grade

| Feature | Reason |
|--------|--------|
| JWT Authentication | Scalable session management |
| bcrypt Hashing | Secure user passwords |
| Cloudinary | Efficient media delivery & transformation |
| Async Error Handler | Prevents crashes due to unhandled promises |
| Centralized Config | Easier to manage and scale settings |
| Prettier | Team-friendly coding standards |
| Modular Code | Clean separation of concerns and reusability |
| Multer Middleware | Scalable file upload handler |

---

## üß© Next Suggestions

- Add routes and controllers for:
  - Auth (register/login)
  - Video/image upload endpoints
  - User profile management
- Implement validation (e.g., `express-validator` or `Joi`)
- Add role-based access control (RBAC)
- Add logging (`morgan`, `winston`)
- Add request rate limiting (`express-rate-limit`) for security
- Setup testing with `jest` or `mocha`
